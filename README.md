# Traffic Flow optimization
Urban traffic congestion is a major issue in many cities around the world. Efficient traffic management can significantly reduce travel time, fuel consumption, and air pollution. In this case study, you are provided with traffic flow data and traffic signal timings at different intersections in on part of the city, Chennai. The goal is to analyze the data and propose optimization strategies to improve traffic flow.
This part of the city is transforming into a significant IT hub with the development of Tech parks  which will host IT, IT-enabled services (ITeS), global capability centers (GCC), Fintech, Deeptech, and other tech-based sectors. This development is expected to boost employment, infrastructure, and real estate growth. 
Given the IT-centric nature of Madhavaram, the types of vehicles and traffic patterns are influenced by the commuting habits of IT professionals:
## Types of Vehicles:
1.	Private Cars: A significant number of IT professionals commute using private cars, leading to high volumes of car traffic during peak hours.
2.	Two-Wheelers: Many employees prefer two-wheelers for their convenience and ease of navigation through traffic.
3.	Company Buses: IT companies often provide shuttle services for their employees, resulting in a considerable number of company buses on the roads.
4.	Public Transport: The Chennai Metro Rail's Phase 2 expansion, which includes a corridor to Madhavaram, enhances public transport options, making it a popular choice for many commuters
5.	Ride-Sharing Services: Services like Ola and Uber are widely used by IT professionals for their flexibility and convenience.
## Traffic Patterns:
•	Morning Peak Hours (7:00 AM - 10:00 AM): High traffic volumes as IT professionals commute to work. Major intersections and roads leading to TN Tech City experience congestion.
•	Evening Peak Hours (5:00 PM - 8:00 PM): Similar to the morning, there is heavy traffic as employees return home.
•	Off-Peak Hours: Traffic is relatively lighter, but there is still a steady flow of vehicles due to the 24/7 nature of IT operations.
## Traffic Police Availability 
To ensure smooth traffic flow, traffic police officers are deployed at key intersections and roads, especially during peak hours. Here is a typical schedule for traffic police availability:
Morning Peak Hours:
•	7:00 AM - 10:00 AM: High traffic volume as IT professionals commute to work. Traffic police are stationed at major intersections and roads leading to a Tech City to manage congestion and ensure smooth traffic flow.
Midday Hours:
•	12:00 PM - 2:00 PM: Moderate traffic as some employees may step out for lunch or errands. Traffic police presence is reduced but still available at critical points.
Evening Peak Hours:
•	5:00 PM - 8:00 PM: High traffic volume as employees return home. Traffic police are again stationed at major intersections and roads to manage congestion and ensure smooth traffic flow.
Night Hours:
•	8:00 PM - 11:00 PM: Traffic volume decreases, but traffic police are still available at key intersections to manage any late evening traffic.
Off-Peak Hours:
•	11:00 PM - 7:00 AM: Minimal traffic, but traffic police are available on-call for any emergencies or incidents.
